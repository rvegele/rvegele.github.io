<h1>(extra)Ordinary</h1>

<p>AR transform volumes of data into images or animations which are <u>overlaid on real world.</u></p>

<p>Today most AR applications are experienced through mobile devices, but increasingly this will shift to hands-free wearables i.e. HMD's or smart glasses. In addition to simple, entertainment applications, AR is also being applied in far-reaching ways, both in consumer and b2b settings.</p>

<p>changes in navigation, collision detection warnings for drivers. Wearable AR for factory workers production assembly or service instuctions. manuals and traditional training methods</p>

<p>AR enables a new information delivery paradigm</p>

<p>By superimposing digital information directly on real objects or environments AR allows people to process physical and digital at the same time, while eliminating the need to mentally bridge the two. That improves out ability to rapidly and accurately absorb information, make decisions and execute required tasks quickly and efficiently.</p>

<h2>Design POV</h2>

<h3>Interactions</h3>
<p>AR applications on mobile devices can replace physical controls and allow users to operate products and machines remotely. A virtual control panel can be superimposed directly on the product and operated using an AR headset, hand-gestures and voice commands. Technologies underpinning these capabilities are still improving but advances have been rapidly providing for better experiences.</p>

<h3>Extended vision</h3>
<p>AR technology provides a sort of extended vision, revealing features that would otherwise be difficult (or impossible) to see. It affords to enhance visualizations and demonstrate design capabilities in more meaningful ways.</p>

<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>AR technology is already redefining instructions, training and coaching. These functions which improve productivity are costly and labor-intensive, often delivering uneven results. AR provides real-time, on-site, step-by-step visualizations and guidance for tasks such as product assembly or machine operations.</p>

<p>AR creates business value in two broad ways: by becoming a part of the products themselves and by improving performance across the value chain - in product development, manufacturing, marketing, services and other areas. Therefore, design focus on AR experiences should extend beyond creating a better user experience, interfaces or ergonomics for a single product. Every manufacturer needs to carefully consider the disruptive impact that this next-generation technology may have on it's offering and competitive positioning.</p>
